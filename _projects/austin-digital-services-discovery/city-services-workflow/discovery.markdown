In a city the size of Austin, nearing 1 million residents, hundreds of people need to coordinate to be able to produce and maintain the information that enables residents to pay their utility bill, put their recycling out on the right day, or find shelter for a night. We set out to learn what they need to be able to craft and maintain [good digital content](https://medium.com/civiqueso/transitioning-to-service-oriented-language-bd5533cb0404). 

We visited the desks of ten City employees from various departments who authored and published web content. Here’s what we learned by observation and matching opportunities for design.
