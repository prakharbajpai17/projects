## GraphQL is as cool as everyone says it is

Among other things, GraphQL is a great choice for us because it‚Äôs modern and open. Turns out those things are really important! So we [talked about it at our sprint review](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRQZw0IVzNoCbjhMrGgDtjvudFmPPqZ_zyPVMUcTym3ves1Jkpn0m-_tySjMSBZPqwHp20LPPx0vHwZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000#slide=id.g2f011be153_0_696).

## Being a developer is even cooler

As developers, we use GitHub every day. It‚Äôs exciting to see other teams adopt it as part of their workflow, especially when they can use GitHub for their projects. We recently [hosted our first NerdShop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZM53IMixBAT4Wke2OyhXCvZZ12dTwUE6/view?usp=sharing), where everyone learned some basics of git and GitHub. Don‚Äôt know if you should watch the NerdShop? 7 out of 7 people called it ‚Äúworth [their] time.‚Äù

We‚Äôve also been teaching a few people HTML, CSS, and other frontend development techniques. They‚Äôve been using the new skills to [develop their very own prototypes üéâ](https://github.com/cityofaustin/prototypeform/) !

## Generating a static site isn‚Äôt as easy as everyone says it is

We've [previously espoused the great virtues of static site generation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FVZgBBEVOcFV7e2YHGN6C8IwfNBSKmdsNJqnV50i74M/edit#slide=id.g2c4e1e5131_9_60). However, we're also seeing that [there are downsides to static site generation](https://github.com/cityofaustin/janis/issues/132) that might prevent it from being being a viable permanent solution.

## Serving translated content is just as hard as everyone says it is

We have to think about [translating static content](https://github.com/cityofaustin/janis/issues/111) (think of text like ‚ÄúDepartment‚Äù or ‚ÄúHealth and Safety‚Äù) as well as dynamic content created by authors (think of text that describes how to recycle paint). We also need to consider things like [right-to-left languages like Arabic](https://github.com/cityofaustin/janis/issues/131) and [researching how browsers handle Chinese languages](https://github.com/cityofaustin/joplin/pull/50).
