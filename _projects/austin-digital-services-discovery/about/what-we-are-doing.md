**We’re building living digital services that grow, adapt, and improve with user needs.**

The City of Austin offers residents hundreds upon hundreds of services — everything from building permits to supplemental food assistance. Since people are increasingly reliant on mobile devices to accomplish their day-to-day tasks, the ability to access these services online has become imperative.

Towards this end, CTM’s [Office of Design and Delivery](http://odd.austintexas.io/) is in the process of rebuilding the City of Austin’s website to improve resident access to municipal services. An alpha release of the new site can be found at [Alpha.austin.gov](http://alpha.austin.gov/). This site will stand in parallel to the current Austintexas.gov until essential services and content have been transitioned.

Austin.gov is a product, not a project. Resident needs evolve, and the City’s website must grow and adapt to meet those needs. It will be extended and refined continuously based on user research, evolving technologies, and the [City’s strategic priorities](https://austinstrategicplan.bloomfire.com/posts/3301043-austin-strategic-direction-2023-final).

This site is an overview of our approach, shared learnings, and progress we’ve made. If you have questions or comments, [we’d love to hear from you](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/austin-digital-services-discovery/about/contact/).
