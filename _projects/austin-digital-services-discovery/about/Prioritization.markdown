#### Four meetings down...

We completed our initial round of prioritization meetings! We ran four departments (and their services) through our prioritization rubric:
* Health,
* Transportation,
* Development Services,
* And Sustainability.

We are iterating on the process and will be scheduling the next round of prioritizations in an upcoming sprint.

#### Many more to go!

We are tracking our progress on this [department prioritization airtable](https://airtable.com/tblOlcAJkRpQgGdmJ/viwaqKycdujHfu2iF).
