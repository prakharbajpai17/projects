## 1. Put residents first.

Design for users first by committing to fully understanding the needs and expectations of the community, and testing solutions with residents.

**Create actionable content with tools & knowledge for residents to lead a full life.**

Shape content that helps residents accomplish their goals and take advantage of what Austin has to offer. Let accessibility and style standards be our guide.

**Strengthen public trust with transparency.**

Build on current Open Data and engagement practices. Develop workflows for projects to be "Open by Default." Create and share recommendations for how to maintain feedback loops.

**Research and test with residents.**

Conduct face-to-face research with residents, supplemented with quantitative data and industry knowledge. Create a human-centered test group that seeks out a diverse pool of residents to test prototypes.

## 2. Recognize that digital services require teams and competencies, not just software.

Support research, design, delivery, and integration with expert teams and by empowering non-traditional designers and technologists.

**Develop a shared strategy for how to support digital services.**

A document articulating our shared goals, how we’re going to accomplish them, who we need on our teams, and how we’ll be held accountable to reaching those goals.

**Build digital services teams and improve workflows.**

Build teams of experts who can be accountable for meeting digital service goals and creating shared resources that get other departments to join in the movement.

**Identify opportunities for city-wide standards.**

Evaluate opportunities for templating, training, and standardization across departments. Develop guardrails to provide autonomy while ensuring usability, accessibility, and effectiveness.

## 3. Cultivate Digital Community.

Meet experts’ enthusiasm with access to learning opportunities and cross-departmental and cross-discipline connection.

**Contribute to and learn from the broader community.**

Open solutions to comments and code from interested citizens. Encourage collaborative research, design, and development through active community engagement.

**Create opportunities for ongoing learning.**

Support designers and developers by providing opportunities for personal and professional growth. Empower employees to discover and cultivate new skillsets that align with organizational goals.

**Invest in sharable, discoverable code.**

Prioritize open solutions so we can share the source code. Inspire developers to contribute to living applications. Promote a culture of sharing and provide clear methods for collaboration with the technical community.

## 4. Champion iterative, data-informed methodologies.

Adopt an agile approach to technology and workflow design that uses prototyping, testing, and iteration to learn and improve over time, rather than "redesign".

**Establish safe spaces for prototyping & testing.**

Cultivate a supportive technical and cultural environment in which new ideas can flourish. Empower trailblazers with tools to gather insight and data from potential solutions.

**Empower staff to document and share the problems they’re finding and possible solutions.**

Encourage employees to document and share problems and solutions as they find them. Provide tools for teams to establish clear documentation on how to improve.

**Create and support modular, reusable components across departments.**

Develop solutions that can be useful across departments and initiatives. Avoid redundant systems and "reinventing the wheel" with a repository of modular, reusable components.

## 5. Prioritize equity when planning features & functionality.

Seek equitable outcomes in our processes for workflow and technology development across city departments.

**Set aside funds for General Fund depts.**

Set aside at least $2M each year to improve content and functionality for digital services supporting General Fund departments.

**Prioritize resident needs over budget availability.**

Prioritize projects to provide the greatest value for residents, even when enterprise departments are offering more funding for their specific needs.

**Get community feedback on the potential impacts of our actions.**

Check in regularly with community organizations across the city about how we can better serve and represent residents with digital services.

## 6. Support agile procurement strategies that avoid vendor lock-in.

Purchase software one piece at a time, and avoid contracts that lock us into specific solutions, contractors, or vendors. Default to open source.

**Break procurements into 3-month chunks.**

We should never need to wait a year or more to see working software. Every three months our internal and/or vendor teams should release clear, functional results.

**Solve current problems and learn what works.**

Focus development time on solving the key issues that are being experienced, and don’t get distracted by a ten-year plan.

**Avoid vendor lock-in.**

Change contracts and processes to challenge vendors against proprietary software or systems that will reduce our ability to scale, upgrade, or negotiate in the future.
