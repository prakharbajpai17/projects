## Service Team

To better serve the permitting process, the Service Team worked collaboratively with our colleagues at the Residential Review offices to develop a blueprint of the entire service experience.

With the process mapped out, the team can now make meaningful interventions in facilitating a coordinated and improved experience.

We will update this page with work-in-progress as designs are approved.
