## Grackle project tracker v1.0 now online

In December 2017, we released v1.0 of the project tracker: [grackle.austintexas.io](https://grackle.austintexas.io/)

In service of giving people a "bird's eye view" of City projects, it's codenamed "grackle" -- in honor of Austin's favorite inhabitant of [grocery store parking lots](http://kut.org/post/why-do-grackles-flock-grocery-store-parking-lots-dusk). 

v1.0 aims to be a demonstration of what a product like this can do, so it includes a small number of projects. We're currently looking into what the next iteration might look like, and what kinds of projects it might feature.

## Archived design mockups

Designs we used to build v1.0, based on what we [learned in the research phase](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/project-tracking/research/research-findings/).

**Mockup: View of all projects**

[![Mockup of a view of all projects. Displays each project as a card that contains an image, name of the project, short description, lead department, and city goals it corresponds to. Above the card view of projects are several filters. Users would be able to filter by goal (Mobility, Safety, Economic Opportunity, Health, Cultural & Learning, and Government that Works), stage, and lead department. Users would also be able to toggle between a card view and list view of projects.](/uploads/Wireframes%20v2%20-%20Landing%20page%20card%20view.png)](/uploads/Wireframes%20v2%20-%20Landing%20page%20card%20view.png)

**Mockup: Project page**

[![Mockup of project page. This is what users would see if they clicked into one project to learn more. Page contains a short description of the project, project budget, funding source, who's involved (which City departments and outside partners), City goals the project corresponds to, and a human point of contact and email address.](/uploads/Wireframes%20v2%20-%20Project%20page.png)](/uploads/Wireframes%20v2%20-%20Project%20page.png)
