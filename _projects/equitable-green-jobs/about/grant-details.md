### Evaluation Criteria

The agreement to cooperate should establish a semi-formal relationship to share information and allow for some programmatic coordination over the term of the grant to enable a higher likelihood of success. The agreement to cooperate can be submitted as a letter to accompany the application.

Any more formal collaboration or partnership between organizations is at the discretion of those organizations, and is not required as a preferential condition. Should organizations decide to sub-contract, note that subcontractors should also be registered to do business with the City of Austin prior to applying.
