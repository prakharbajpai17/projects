For this event we need to take a look at the special conditions related to displacement that takes place in Austin. Any viable concept must **account for what we are not allowed to do, the velocity of local displacement, speculative market forces, and the magnitude of the problem**. 

### Tools that are not available in Texas… 
  * During 2018, more than 20% of renters in Austin were **spending more than half their income in rent**. 
  * Many tools allowable in other states are simply **not allowable under Texas State Law**:
    * Rent control
    * Inclusionary zoning
    * Protection from discrimination based upon source of incomeuse of vouchers
    * Affordable housing linkage fees (also known as impact fees)
    * Tenant right-to-purchase program, and flat dollar homestead property tax exemption for low-value properties.

### The velocity of local displacement
  * Ranked the highest-growth city in the country in 2018, Austin has experienced a population growth of 21% over the last eight years. 
  * The median rent has **increased 30% in the last 5 years**. 
    * **2018** Median Gross Rent in Austin: **$1,314**
    * **2013** Median Gross Rent in Austin: **$1,008**
  * The home value has **increased 56% between 2013 and 2018**.  
    * **2018** Median Home value of owner-occupied housing units: **$365,500** 
    * **2013** Median Home Value: **$234,800**
  * These numbers signal a **hot real estate speculation market** that has left original Austinites struggling to afford continuing to live within the city limits. 

### Speculative market forces 
  * Real estate investors are incentivized to seek the highest return on investment. 
    * They pursue the acquisition of **properties that start off with a low value**, but have an **attractive proximity to job, transportation, entertainment amenities** such that if remodeled, demolitioned and densified, allow for a **sizeable return on investment**. 
    * Properties like these are usually **found in historically underinvested neighborhoods**. 
  * The pressure of the resulting **increased housing costs is felt citywide**, however, the **impact of a forced move on a gentrifying neighborhood is higher than in a non-gentrifying neighborhood**. 
    * The person being forced to move **loses the ability** to afford **to stay in the same neighborhood**. 
  * Displacement has lasting impacts on physical and psychological well being, community cohesion, and long-term economic mobility.
  * When **low-income people of color are displaced** from communities by rising housing prices, we often **see patterns of re-segregation emerge**, deepening racial inequity. 

### The magnitude of need 
  * Strides have been made with the City’s largest affordable housing bond, however: 
    * The current amount of **affordable units funded does not match the amount needed**
    * Those units to be built will take **several years to be ready for use**
  * **City services** are funded to meet only a fraction of the need and may **need to transition to a displacement mitigation frame**. 
  * In gentrifying areas **69,957 renter units** are **making less than $75,000** and **23,608 owner units making less than $75,000**.
