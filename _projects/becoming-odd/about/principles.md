## Our Design & Delivery Principles

Initially referred to as our "Digital Service Values," these were developed over the Summer of 2017 as part of "Tech Stack Discovery" project. When we launched our Office of Design & Delivery in May 2018, our team took another pass to refine them as principles for our work across all services (digital and otherwise).
