## Position descriptions

Many applicants' first impressions of us come from our position descriptions. We've taken care to craft these to communicate our mission and goals as well as the specifics of what we're looking for in each role, and the titles are those that we'd expect to see at any design or technology firm – service designer, content strategist, product manager – not the 'IT Business Systems Analyst' role that our HR system uses behind the scenes.

Our latest versions are available as markdown files on our recruiting website, and we'll be adjusting the content and adding more over the next few months.
