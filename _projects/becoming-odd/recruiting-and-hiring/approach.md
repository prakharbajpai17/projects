## We believe that our culture is our greatest asset, and that's defined by our people

We've refined our processes to help us recruit and hire skilled practitioners with a passion for public service, a commitment to curiosity, and a deep interest in raising the capabilities of everyone we work with.

This work is informed by our  [Principles](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/becoming-odd/about/principles/) and [Values](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/becoming-odd/about/values/) and is based on work by our friends and former colleagues at the [CFPB](https://consumerfinance.gov) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov). We're excited to see how it can inform the work of more cities and public sector organizations!
